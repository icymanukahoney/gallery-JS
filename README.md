## Art Gallery - JS and SASS Project

*Art Gallery JS Project - A one-page JavaScript app featuring works by famous artists.*

**For our project, we utilize Swiper and Modal.**

### Users can view a list of artworks, explore details of each artwork, filter items by category (in our case, by artists), and search.

### Developed by Maria Stromova. 
:pouting_woman: **I am a student at Yoobee College, specializing in UX Design and Web Development.**

**In the realm of user experience (UX) design, I have learned the art of crafting interfaces that prioritize the needs and preferences of users. The digital products I create are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and enjoyable to use.**

**Web development is the backbone of my journey as a developer. I have delved into the world of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, and beyond. Additionally, I have explored frameworks and libraries like React, and Bootstrap to deliver more robust and efficient web solutions.**
